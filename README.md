# Taxonomy Terms List Block

WordPress plugin that displays a list of a post terms for a selected taxonomy.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository to your `wp-content/plugins` folder.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start watching for changes in the `src` folder. This will start Webpack that will regenerate the JS/CSS bundles that are loaded from Gutenberg to display the block.

Run `npm run build` to generate the production-ready bundles before releasing a new version in wp.org.
